<p>
How do you know whether a sentence completion feels better to you? You will probably immediately gravitate towards one way of completing the sentence that sounds the most natural to you. However, some sentence completions may sound equally good, and that is ok! There are no right or wong answers.

<p>
One last thing: Make sure your browser window is maximized so it fills your whole screen!
