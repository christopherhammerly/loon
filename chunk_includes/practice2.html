<b>Instructions</b>
</p>

<p>
Once the you have read the beginning of the sentence, you will be shown two phrases to complete it. You should choose the option that intuitively sounds best to you. To respond that the completion on the left side sounds best, press the 'F' key with your left pointer finger; to respond that the completion of the right side sounds best, press the 'J' key with your right pointer finger. We chose 'F' and 'J' so that you can respond quickly by keeping your pointer fingers on those keys. Please DO NOT use a mouse, trackpad or touchscreen.
</p>
<p>
We would like you to respond as quickly as you can, so go with your gut instinct about the sentence fragment, and don't overthink your response! To help you go with your first impulse, we're giving you a limit of 10 seconds to respond.
