<p>
The last word of the sentence fragment will have an ellipsis (...). Then you'll be asked to judge whether or not the sentence was 'grammatical' or 'ungrammatical', as well as how confident you are in your response. You will make your judgments using your right hand, and your confidence ratings with your left hand. To respond that a sentence fragment is grammatical, press the 'J' key with your right pointer finger; to respond that it is ungrammatical, press the 'K' key with your right middle finger. We chose 'J' and 'K' so that you can respond quickly by keeping your right hand on those keys. Please DO NOT use a mouse or trackpad.
</p>
<p>
We would like you to respond as quickly as you can, so go with your gut instinct about the sentence fragment, and don't overthink your response! To help you go with your first impulse, we're giving you a limit of 2 seconds to respond.
</p>
<p>
After you judge the sentence, you will be asked to rate your confidence in your response using three options. If you're not very confident in your response, choose 'Not at all confident'. If you're a little unsure, but mostly confident, choose 'Somewhat confident'. If you are highly confident in your choice, you should choose 'Very confident'. For this, you use the "1", "2", or "3" keys on the top of the keyboard using your left hand. You should keep your left hand sitting on these keys so you are always ready to respond.
</p>

<p>
It's natural for your confidence to vary quite a lot from response to response, so you should be sure to use all three confidence levels over the course of the experiment. Your intuitions won't always be very clear, and that's OK. Just do your best and go with your gut.
</p>

<p>
Finally, one quirk of this study is that the confidence rating will appear even if you do not make your judgment within the 2 second deadline. If you've missed the judgment, then just press the lowest confidence rating ("1") to move on to the next sentence.
