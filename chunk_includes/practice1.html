<b>Instructions</b>
</p>
<p>

Welcome! In this experiment, you will be completing English sentences. 
</p>

<p>
The beginnings of sentences will be presented to you automatically, word by word, at a steady pace. It'll seem a bit fast at first, but you'll get used to it quickly. It's about as fast as people normally read words.
</p>
<p>
Before each sentence, you will see a cross ("+") to indicate that the sentence is about to begin. When you see the cross, get ready to read a sentence. It will disappear after one second, and the sentence will begin automatically when it disappears.
